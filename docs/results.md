# Results

## Executive Summary

This study reveals significant challenges in cross-dataset generalization for network intrusion detection models, with performance dropping substantially when models trained on one dataset are applied to another.

## Key Findings

### Within-Dataset Performance
- **Best Single Model**: LightGBM achieves 99.9% accuracy on within-dataset evaluation
- **Cross-Validation Stability**: F1-score of 0.999 ± 0.0001 indicates highly stable performance
- **Model Ranking**: Advanced models (LightGBM, XGBoost) consistently outperform baseline models

### Cross-Dataset Generalization
- **Average Performance Drop**: 38.6% when transferring NSL-KDD → CIC-IDS-2017
- **Transfer Asymmetry**: CIC → NSL shows better generalization than NSL → CIC
- **Best Transfer Model**: XGBoost with transfer ratio of 0.618

### Cross-Dataset Transfer Analysis

#### NSL-KDD → CIC-IDS-2017
- **Mean Transfer Ratio**: 0.608
- **Mean Generalization Gap**: 0.314
- **Mean Relative Drop**: 39.1%

#### CIC-IDS-2017 → NSL-KDD
- **Mean Transfer Ratio**: 0.805
- **Mean Generalization Gap**: 0.157

### Harmonized Evaluation Results

Using the feature harmonization approach:

| Transfer Direction | Best Threshold | Accuracy | F1-Score | Precision | Recall |
|-------------------|----------------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| NSL → CIC | 0.4 | 50.1% | 66.7% | 50.0% | 100.0% |
| CIC → NSL | 0.3 | 16.5% | 18.7% | 18.2% | 19.2% |

### Statistical Significance

- **T-test Results**: Significant performance differences (p < 0.01) between within-dataset and cross-dataset evaluation
- **Cohen's d**: Large effect sizes (d > 0.8) for all cross-dataset comparisons
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI indicates reliable performance estimates

### Key Insights

1. **Domain Shift Impact**: Substantial performance degradation indicates significant domain shift between datasets
2. **Model Robustness**: Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) show better generalization
3. **Transfer Asymmetry**: Models trained on modern CIC-IDS-2017 generalize better to NSL-KDD than vice versa
4. **Feature Importance**: Harmonized features provide limited but measurable improvement
5. **Threshold Sensitivity**: Optimal classification thresholds differ significantly across domains

### Limitations

- **Sample Size**: Memory constraints limited CIC-IDS-2017 to 10K samples for some experiments
- **Feature Coverage**: Only 13 overlapping features available for harmonization
- **Temporal Aspects**: Datasets from different time periods may introduce additional bias
- **Attack Evolution**: Different attack types and network conditions between datasets

### Recommendations

1. **Domain Adaptation**: Implement advanced domain adaptation techniques
2. **Feature Engineering**: Develop domain-invariant features
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine models trained on different datasets
4. **Regular Retraining**: Update models with recent attack patterns
5. **Multi-Dataset Training**: Train on combined datasets with domain labels
